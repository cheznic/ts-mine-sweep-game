# TS Mine Sweep

### Play it [here](https://cheznic.github.io/ts-mine-sweep-game/)

This application is a simple Minesweep clone LOOSELY patterned after the [Microsoft's](https://www.microsoft.com/) 1992 Windows 3.1 Minesweeper game.  It's not an exact clone, but has a similar game play.

I created this game as an opportunity to learn Typescript, and how it can be used to create stand alone JS applications for the browser.

### Technologies used:
- [HTML 5 canvas element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#2dcontext) provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, art, or other visual images on the fly.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
- [webpack cli](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/) provides a flexible set of commands for developers to increase speed when setting up a custom webpack project.
- [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) is the typescript loader for webpack.
